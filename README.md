# Restaurant Finder API

## Task
* Your task is to create a Restaurant Finder API in NodeJS. The system must enable the user to **Create a Restaurant**, **Find a restaurant based on some criteria** and **Delete all restaurants**.
### Business rules

* You may assume that all restaurants are in the same street, so the position is **linear**, and can have values from **0** to **200**.
* You must create a "**Create a restaurant**" API that enables users to create a Restaurant.
* You may store your restaurants **in memory in your preferred data structure**. There is no need to use a Database for the sake of this exercise.
* There can not be two restaurants in the same position. (See more about this in Validation Section)
A **Restaurant** is an object like this one below:
```
{
  "name": "123",
  "position": 200,
  "category": "Pizza",
  "rating": 5
}
```
* You may also create a **Get Restaurants API**. This API will receive the **Position** of the user (also linear from 0 to 200), and your job is to return the best restaurants according to the **criteria** passed via the request body.
* The user can't be in the same position as a restaurant (See more on Validation Section)

### Criteria of Get Restaurants API
1. **Category**: You should filter by the category contained in the user's request body.
2. **orderPriority**: The user can choose between sorting by **distance**, in which case you must return the **nearest** restaurants first, and sorting by **rating**, in which case you must return the best **rated** restaurants first.
3. **distanceLimit:** Optionally, the user can also choose a distanceLimit. If nothing is passed your system should set the **value 30 as default.** This value is bi-directional, which means that if the user is at **position 100**, and chooses **distanceLimit 50**, you should display restaurants **from 50 to 150.**

### The API
### Create a restaurant POST /restaurant
### REQUEST
```
{
  "name": "123",
  "position": 200,
  "category": "Pizza",
  "rating": 5
}
```
### RESPONSE - 201
```
{
  "name": "123",
  "position": 200,
  "category": "Pizza",
  "rating": 5
}
```

### Validation
* All four fields are mandatory. If they are not sent your API must return:
### RESPONSE - 400
```
{
   "message": "There are missing fields"
}
```
* Position should be an integer from 0 to 200. If that rule is not followed your API must return: 
### RESPONSE - 400
```
{
 "message": "position must be an integer from 0 to 200"
}
```
* Rating must be an integer from 0 to 5. If that rules is not followed your API must return.
### RESPONSE - 400
```
{
  "message": "rating must be an integer from 0 to 200"
}
```
* There must not be two restaurants in the same position. In case of a request with an unavailable position your API must return:
### RESPONSE - 400
```
{
 "message": "Position not available"
}
```
* You can choose how to set category field.

### Get restaurants POST /restaurants
### REQUEST
```
{
    "category": "Burguer",
    "orderPriority": "distance",
    "distanceLimit": 120,
    "position": 94
}
```
### RESPONSE - 200
```
[
    {
        "name": "123",
        "position": 180,
        "category": "Burguer",
        "rating": 5
    },
    {
        "name": "123",
        "position": 199,
        "category": "Burguer",
        "rating": 5
    }
]
```
### Validation
* **Category, orderPriority and position are mandatory attributes.** If they are not sent your API should return:
### RESPONSE - 400
```
{
  "message": "There are missing fields"
}
```
* distanceLimit is **optional**, and its default value in your system **must be 30**. If the user sends it in the API is must be an integer. If it's not your API should return:
### RESPONSE - 400 
```
{
  "message": "Distance limit should be an integer"
}
```
* **orderPriority** can only receive values **distance** or **rating**. If any other value is received your API must return:
### RESPONSE - 400
```
{
 "message": "Order priority should be either distance or rating"
}
```
* **Position**, like in the above API, should also be an **integer between 0 and 200.** If any toher value your API must return:
### RESPONSE - 400
```
{
  "message": "position must be an integer from 0 to 200"
}
```
### DELETE /restaurants
### RESPONSE - 204 NO CONTENT
* This API must delete all restaurants.

* You are allowed to install these parckages only.
```
$ npm i express --save
```
```
$ npm i nodemon jest supertest --save-dev
```
### Test case
1. Should create a restaurant given valid parameters
2. Should return code 400 when name is missing or empty
3. Should return code 400 when position is missing or empty
4. Should return code 400 when position is greater than 200
5. Should return code 400 when position is negative
6. Should return code 400 when rating is grater than 5
7. Should return code 400 when rating is lower than 1
8. Should return code 400 when trying to send two restaurants with same position
9. Should get Restaurants in the right order, given orderPriority is rating
10. Should get Restaurants in the right order, given orderPriority is distance
11. Should get Restaurants without restaurants outside default distance limit 30
12. Should get Restaurants without restaurants with a non selected category
13. Should return 400 when calling get restaurants without all mandatory attributes
14. Should return 400 when calling get restaurants without a wrong orderPriority
15. Should return 400 when calling get restaurants without non intenger distance limit
16. Should return 400 when calling get restaurants without integer outside range
17. Should return 400 when calling get restaurants without a position that belongs to an restaurant
### Code Organization and best practices
Your code may be evaluated manually in the future. Make sure you keep your code clean and understandable as if it were a real-life program. Project your code thinking about a production environment.
